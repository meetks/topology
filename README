 Too often in networking we have setup with elaborate setups. The idea here to 
have a script that using CDP to discover what ports are connected. Ideally, I 
want to specify a set of switches and discover connections to and from each 
switch

Specially, in datacenters or Layer 2  testbeds this is very useful.
