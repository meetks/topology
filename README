 Too often in networking we have elaborate setups. The idea here is to 
have a script that uses CDP to discover what ports are connected. Ideally, I 
want to specify a set of switches and discover connections to and from each 
switch in those set of switches specified. For testing Im using Cisco Nexus 5k switches.

Starting small I can extend this later.
