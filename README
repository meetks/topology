 Too often in networking we have elaborate setups. The idea here is to 
have a script that using CDP to discover what ports are connected. Ideally, I 
want to specify a set of switches and discover connections to and from each 
switch in the set of switches specified. For testing Im using Cisco Nexus 5k switches.

Specially, in datacenters or Layer 2 testbeds this is very useful.
